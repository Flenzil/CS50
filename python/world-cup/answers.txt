Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Several teams do not appear in smaller samples. They don't have enough of a chance to win in just 1000 samples.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would say 10000 simulations is enough to ensure every team is represented.
